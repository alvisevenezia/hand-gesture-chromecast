The project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition system for controlling a Chromecast device. It involves capturing hand movements using a camera, processing the video feed, and recognizing specific gestures to perform actions such as play, pause, and volume control. The README.md file will provide an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any additional information relevant to developers and contributors.
